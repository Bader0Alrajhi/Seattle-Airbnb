### Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python 3.

### Project Motivation
For this project, I was interestested in using Seattle Airbnb data from Jan 2016 to Feb 2017 to better understand:

1. What are the top 5 expensive neighbourhoods?
2. What are the top 5 expensive hosts?
3. Examine linear regression model for price prediction.


The full set of files related to this course are owned by Kaggle ([Visit Website](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle)).


### File Descriptions
There is one notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.


### Results
The main findings of the code can be found at recap section in the end of the Jupyter at Seattle Airbnb Project.ipynb.

### Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements
Must give credit to Kaggle for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle ([Visit Website](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle)). Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
